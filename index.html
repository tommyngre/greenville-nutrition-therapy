        <p>Hi! I’m Julie and I thank you for taking the time to get to know me.</p>
        <p>I am a Greenville transplant originally from Atlanta, GA. I am a registered dietitian, licenced
          dietitian in the state of SC and the founder of Greenville Nutrition Therapy. Since 2012, I
          have specialized in the treatment of eating disorders and adolescent health. Discovering the
          joy I received from helping individuals navigate their journey to freedom with food and contentment
          in caring for their bodies has led me here to Greenville Nutrition Therapy. I work to individualize
          each client’s treatment plan while collaborating with all of your community providers including
          your therapist, primary care providers and psychiatrist, as needed. I am committed to providing
          weight inclusive, culturally sensitive, evidence based treatment to help all individuals achieve
          freedom and full recovery from their eating disorder. I regard diversity and believe that all
          diversity is to be valued and honored.
        </p>
        <p>I hold a bachelors of science in exercise science from the University of South Carolina and a
          masters of science in nutrition from Georgia State University. I started my career in an eating
          disorder treatment facility after completing my coordinated nutrition program. I have worked
          in levels of care ranging from outpatient to partial hospitalization and was the nutrition
          supervisor at the Eating Recovery Center of the Carolinas prior to starting my private practice.
        </p>
        <p>I believe…
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>That it’s not about what you eat; it’s about how you eat</li>
          <li>That eating disorder recovery is possible</li>
          <li>That your body is good</li>
          <li>That chocolate should be eaten every day...if you like it</li>
          <li>That you can eat freely and healthfully and those are not mutually exclusive</li>
          <li>That nutrition science can empower you</li>
          <li>That “healthy” is holistic and much more than simply diet and exercise</li>
          <li>That healthcare should be weight inclusive vs weight-normative</li>
          <li>That eating and movement are meant to be enjoyed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Professional Memberships…</p>

    <h1>Testimonials</h1>

    <p>"My experience with Julie was unmatched. Coming to Julie, I felt lost and hopeless. In the crux of
      one of the most debilitating eating disorder periods of my life, I was directed to Julie to complete
      a triad relationship with my therapist. After our first meeting, I knew Julie was special. Her
      caring approach felt more like a friendship than anything else. I looked forward to our meetings
      each week. Julie always sought to understand my struggle and provided endless support to officially
      overcome an eating disorder that had been ongoing for 8 years. I will forever hold onto the value,
      lessons, and laughs we shared during our time together. With the help of Julie, I found freedom
      and that is the greatest gift I have ever received." (JB, client)</p>

    <p>"Working with Julie has made such a positive impact on my life. I used to have a negative relationship
      with food and be set in destructive patterns of eating. I held onto so much guilt around any food
      I ate, but through my recovery with Julie I live with more freedom now. I don't obsess over calories
      as much as I did before and because of that I'm able to live the healthy life I've wanted to live.
      I have the healthiest relationship with food and exercise I've had in years, all with Julie's care
      and support." (SJ, client)</p>

    <p>“When I first started out on my journey with recovery from an eating disorder, I never thought full
      recovery from Anorexia would be possible, but I can honestly say that Julie has made me believe
      that full recovery is 100% attainable. I’ve worked with a few different dietitians before Julie,
      but I’ve never clicked with any as I do with her. Her ability to make a daunting task seem doable,
      as well as her ability to make you feel like you are worth recovery, is truly second to none. I
      have a love for life that I never knew could exist, and I truly attribute a lot of this new attitude
      towards life to Julie and her expertise. Julie, I can say with absolute certainty that I would
      not be where I am in my recovery today without you, your compassion and understanding, and your
      willingness to help me live my healthiest life possible. You have been a true God-send in my life,
      and I can only pray I am able to touch the lives of others in the way that you have touched mine!”
      (LH, client)</p>
